Welcome to my GitHub repository for projects completed during my one-month virtual internship in Java programming at Codsoft. 
This repository showcases a range of basic projects, each designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts and skills in Java development. 
Below is an overview of the projects included:

# 1 . ATM Interface
A simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as checking balances, depositing money, and withdrawing funds. The project emphasizes user interaction through a console-based interface and the implementation of secure data handling practices.

# 2 . Currency Converter
A console-based application that converts amounts between different currencies. It utilizes real-time exchange rates and includes features such as multiple currency options and user-friendly input validation. This project highlights the use of Java for handling numerical data and basic arithmetic operations.

# 3 . Number Game
An interactive game where users guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The application provides feedback on the accuracy of the guess and tracks the number of attempts taken to find the correct answer. This project demonstrates the use of loops, conditional statements, and random number generation in Java.

# 4 . Student Grade Calculator
A simple tool for calculating students' grades based on their scores in various subjects. The application can compute average grades and provide a letter grade as an output. It showcases the use of arrays, control structures, and basic algorithms for data processing.

# 5 . Student Management System
A basic system for managing student information, including details such as name, ID, and grades. It allows for adding, updating, and viewing student records. This project illustrates object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, and data encapsulation.
